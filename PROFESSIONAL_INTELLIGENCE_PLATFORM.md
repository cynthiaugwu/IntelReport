## üîç SOPHISTICATED ANALYTICAL CAPABILITIES

### Structured Analytic Techniques (SATs)
- **Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)**: Evaluates 3-5 alternative hypotheses with evidence-based selection
- **Key Assumptions Check (KAC)**: Identifies underlying assumptions that could invalidate analysis
- **Source Triangulation**: Cross-references claims across multiple sources for corroboration
- **Quality of Information Check**: Assesses reliability and credibility of intelligence sources
- **What-If Analysis**: Explores alternative scenarios by challenging key assumptions
- **Devil's Advocacy**: Generates contrarian analysis for Red Team mode

### Invisible Processing Engine
- **AnalyticalTrail Class**: Tracks every analytical step for transparency and audit
- **Confidence Calculation**: 4-factor weighted methodology (Source Agreement 40%, Historical Precedent 20%, Logical Consistency 15%, Technical Feasibility 25%)
- **Assumption Identification**: Pattern-based detection of temporal, causal, actor intent, and capability assumptions
- **Hypothesis Evaluation**: Evidence-based probability scoring with rejection reasons

### Multi-Source Synthesis
- **Simultaneous Processing**: Handles up to 5 documents with cross-source pattern identification
- **Contradiction Resolution**: Identifies and suggests approaches for resolving source conflicts
- **Temporal Pattern Analysis**: Detects escalation/de-escalation trends across time
- **Entity Relationship Mapping**: Maps relationships between entities across documents
- **Enhanced Claim Processing**: Sophisticated analysis with ACH and confidence scoring
