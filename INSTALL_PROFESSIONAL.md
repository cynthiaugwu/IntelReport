# IntelliReport Professional Installation Guide

## Quick Fix for Import Error

The error you're seeing is because Pydantic isn't installed in your current Python environment. Here are the exact commands to fix this:

### Option 1: Install in Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/cynthiaugwu/intellireport
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install pydantic anthropic pyyaml
python test_import_fix.py
```

### Option 2: Install System-Wide (if allowed)
```bash
pip3 install --user pydantic anthropic pyyaml
python3 test_import_fix.py
```

### Option 3: Use Homebrew (macOS)
```bash
brew install python
pip3 install pydantic anthropic pyyaml
python3 test_import_fix.py
```

## Verify Professional Rebuild
Once dependencies are installed:

```bash
# Test imports (should show all green checkmarks)
python3 test_import_fix.py

# Test full professional analysis (requires API key)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your_anthropic_api_key'
python3 test_professional_rebuild.py
```
